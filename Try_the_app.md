# Accessing Our DApp: A Quick Guide
---
Welcome! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to access and seamlessly interact with our decentralized application, hosted directly on Netlify. Get ready to dive in!

## Step 1: Launch the DApp
---
You can find our DApp right here: [https://dapptest1.netlify.app/](https://dapptest1.netlify.app/). Just click the link, and you're halfway there!

## Step 2: Configure Your MetaMask Wallet
---
To truly experience the DApp, you'll need to tell MetaMask where to find our special testing environment. Don't worry, it's super easy!

1.  **Open MetaMask:** First, open up your MetaMask browser extension.
2.  **Add a New Network:**
    * Look for the **network dropdown** at the top (it probably says "Ethereum Mainnet"). Click it!
    * Select "**Add network**."
    * Then, choose "**Add a network manually**."
3.  **Enter Network Details:** Now, simply fill in the blanks with this information:
    * **Network Name:** `My Ngrok Ganache` (Feel free to call it anything you like, but this is a good, descriptive name!)
    * **New RPC URL:** `YOUR_CURRENT_NGROK_HTTP_URL_HERE` (This is the magic link to our testing network! We'll show you how to get it next.)
    * **Chain ID:** `1337`
    * **Currency Symbol:** `ETH`
    * **Block Explorer URL (Optional):** You can leave this blank; it won't affect your access.

4.  Click "**Save**," and you're all set with your network configuration!

## Step 3: Get Your Ngrok URL
---
Since our testing environment uses a temporary Ngrok URL, it changes from time to time. To get the most current `YOUR_CURRENT_NGROK_HTTP_URL_HERE`, please reach out to me directly!

You can contact me via email at:
* **hundabent@gmail.com**
* **h00540231@hct.ac.ae**

Just send a quick message, and I'll send you the latest URL so you can connect without a hitch.

## Step 4: Understanding Account Roles
---
Once you're connected, your MetaMask accounts will play specific roles within the DApp:

* The **very first account** you use to log in will automatically become the **Admin/Employer account**. This account has special privileges!
* All **other accounts** you connect will be designated as **Employee accounts**.

We've already set up **four sample employee accounts** for you to start with. And here's a cool part: as the Admin/Employer, you can easily add new employees simply by logging in with your admin account and entering the **public address** of their MetaMask wallet. It's that simple to expand your team!
