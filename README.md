# ⏰ Decentralized Time Tracker DApp

> **A full-stack blockchain application for decentralized employee time tracking, built with Solidity, Hardhat, Ganache, and React.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to the **Time Tracker DApp**! This project lets employers and employees interact transparently on the blockchain:
- **Employers** can register employees and track their work hours.
- **Employees** can log in, view their records, and interact with their data.

This guide will help you set up, run, and test the DApp from scratch.

## ⚡ Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Employed
   ```
2. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

---

---


## 🟤 Starting Ganache (Persistent Blockchain)
Start Ganache in persistent mode (from the project root):
```bash
npx ganache --db ganache_data --chain.chainId 1337 --wallet.mnemonic "test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
```
- This creates a local blockchain with persistent data in `ganache_data/`.
- **Do not delete or modify `ganache_data/` if you want to keep your blockchain state.**

---

---


## 🛠️ Compiling and Deploying Contracts
1. **Compile contracts with Hardhat:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. **Deploy contracts to Ganache:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/hardhat-deploy.js --network ganache
   ```
   - This deploys your contracts and updates the frontend with the correct contract address and ABI.

---

---


## 🖥️ Running the Frontend
1. **Start the React app:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
2. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

---


## 🦊 Using MetaMask
1. **Add the Ganache network to MetaMask:**
   - **Network Name:** `Ganache Local`
   - **New RPC URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
   - **Chain ID:** `1337`
   - **Currency Symbol:** `ETH`
2. **Import Ganache accounts:**
   - Use the private keys printed by Ganache at startup (or from this mnemonic: `test test test test test test test test test test test junk`).
   - The **first account** is the employer (deployer).
   - Others can be used as employees.
3. **Switch between accounts in MetaMask to test employer/employee roles.**

## 🧪 Testing the DApp

**Employer:**
- Log in with the first Ganache account.
- Add employees by entering their Ethereum address and name.

**Employee:**
- Switch MetaMask to an employee account.
- Log in to view and interact with your data.

---

---


## 💾 Persistence & Resetting

**Persistence:**
- As long as you use the same `ganache_data/` directory and mnemonic, your contracts and data will persist across Ganache restarts.

**Resetting:**
- To reset the blockchain, stop Ganache and delete the `ganache_data/` directory:
  ```bash
  rm -rf ganache_data/
  ```
- Then restart Ganache and redeploy your contracts.

---

---


## 🛟 Troubleshooting

- **MetaMask not connecting:**
  - Make sure MetaMask is on the correct network (`localhost:8545`, Chain ID 1337).
- **Contract not found or wrong address:**
  - Always redeploy after resetting Ganache, and make sure the frontend uses the latest contract address.
- **Dependency errors:**
  - Ensure you are using compatible versions of Hardhat and ethers (ethers v5 for Hardhat plugins).
- **Revert errors:**
  - Make sure you are using the employer account to add employees, and that the employee address is not already registered.

## 📝 Useful Commands

- **Start Ganache:**  
  `npx ganache --db ganache_data --chain.chainId 1337 --wallet.mnemonic "test test test test test test test test test test test junk"`
- **Compile contracts:**  
  `npx hardhat compile`
- **Deploy contracts:**  
  `npx hardhat run scripts/hardhat-deploy.js --network ganache`
